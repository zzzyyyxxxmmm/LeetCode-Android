<div class="spoilers" style="display: none;"><b>Some hints:</b>

<p>Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)</p>

<p>If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.</p>

<p>You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?</p>

<p>There is a more generic way of solving this problem.</p>
